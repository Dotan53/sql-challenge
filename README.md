# SQL-challenge
# February 2025

# Summary
This repository contains the files for the Bootcamp SQL challenge (Modul 9).

This Challenge is Divided into 3 parts:

  *  Data Modeling
  *  Data engineering
  *  Data analysis

An entity relationship diagram ("RED") visually models the schema.

The EmployeesSKL directory contains the SQL database schema (engineering) and a queries file for the analysis.

## Note:
  *  Tables should be created in the schema order provided, to avoid potential issues with key mapping between the tables.

  *  Before queries can be run but after database and tables creation, the .cvs files in the data directory must be imported to the database and tables.
